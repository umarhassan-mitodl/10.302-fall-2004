Assignments
-----------

Reading assignments are listed on the syllabus. Additional reading assignments may occasionally be announced in class.

Homework assignments will be given out on Wednesdays and will be due at the beginning of class the next Wednesday, unless otherwise specified. **No late homework will be accepted.**

Recitations
-----------

Recitation sections will be devoted to working example problems. Problems will be handed out in class the Wednesday before recitation. You should work the problems to the best of your ability before coming to class on Tuesday. Students will be called on in recitation to work problems. There will be a ten minute **closed book** quiz during certain recitations. The problems will be drawn from the material contained in the lectures, text readings, or the homework. Example problems scheduled to be covered that day are likely to be emphasized. We will strive to emphasize concepts rather than mathematical details, but the problems may be quantitative. **The lowest quiz grade will be dropped. There will be no make-up quizzes.**

Labs and Exams
--------------

There is a laboratory component to the course consisting of two experiments: a conduction and a heat exchanger experiment. Additional details on the labs can be found on the Heat Transfer Project website. There are three one hour exams and a final exam.

10.302 Policy on Collaboration
------------------------------

The fundamental principle of academic integrity is that you must fairly represent the authorship of the intellectual content of the work you submit for credit. In the context of 10.302, this means that if you consult with others (such as fellow students, TA's, faculty) in the process of completing homework, you must acknowledge their contribution in any way that reflects their true ownership of the ideas and methods you borrowed.

Discussion among students to understand the homework problems or to prepare for laboratories or quizzes is encouraged. Copies of previous year's problems and quizzes ("bibles") will be made available and are considered useful in the educational process. **Collaboration on homework is allowed as long as all references (both literature and people) used are named clearly at the end of the assignment.** Word-by-word copies of someone else's solution or parts of a solution handed in for credit will be considered cheating unless there is a reference to the source for any part of the work which was copied verbatim. **Failure to cite other student's contribution to your homework solution will be considered cheating.** Official Institute policy regarding academic honesty can be found in the MIT Bulletin Course and Degrees Issue under "Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations."

Study groups are considered an educationally beneficial activity. However, at the end of each problem on which you collaborated with another student you must cite the students and the interaction. The purpose of this is to acknowledge their contribution to your work. Some examples follow:

1.  You discuss concepts, approaches and methods that could be applied to a homework problem before either of you start your written solution. This process is encouraged. You are not required to make a written acknowledgment of this type of interaction.  
    
2.  After working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which confirms your solution. You should acknowledge that the other student's solution was used to check your own. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgments is made.  
    
3.  After working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which alerts you to an error in your own work. You should state at the end of the problem that you corrected your error on the basis of checking answers with the other student. No credit will be lost if the solution is correct and the acknowledgment is made, and no direct copying of the correct solution is involved.  
    
4.  You and another student work through a problem together exchanging ideas as the solution progresses. Each of you should state at the end of the problem that you worked jointly. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgment is made.  
    
5.  You copy all or part of a solution from a reference such as a textbook or a "bible." You should cite the reference. Partial credit will be given, since there is some educational value in reading and understanding the solution. However, this practice is strongly discouraged, and should be used only when you are unable to solve the problem without assistance.  
    
6.  You copy verbatim all or part of a solution from another student. This process is prohibited. You will receive no credit for verbatim copying from another student when you have not made any intellectual contribution to the work you are both submitting for credit.  
    
7.  **Verbatim copying of any material which you submit for credit without reference to the source is considered to be academically dishonest.**
